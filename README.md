🌐 Omar Ashurbayov – Portfolio Website

Live Website: omarashurbayov.com￼
Built with React + Tailwind CSS

🚀 About the Project

After weeks of experimenting with layouts, colors, and animations (and maybe a few design-induced breakdowns 😅), I’m proud to share my personal portfolio website — a project that represents my growth as a Front-End & Software Developer.

The site was built to showcase my experience, projects, and technical skills, while maintaining a focus on modern design, performance, and responsiveness.

This marks an exciting step forward in my journey as a developer — and hopefully a gateway to many new opportunities and collaborations ahead.
